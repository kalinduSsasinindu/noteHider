# 🎖️ Military-Grade Device Binding Security Demonstrations

This directory contains comprehensive security demonstrations that show how the NoteHider app implements military-grade device binding to protect against various attack scenarios.

## 🚀 Quick Start

Run any of these demonstrations to see device binding security in action:

```bash
# Basic device binding demonstration
dart demo/test_device_binding.dart

# Advanced attack simulation (6 different attack types)
dart demo/advanced_attack_simulation.dart

# Run all demonstrations
dart demo/run_all_demos.dart
```

## 📋 Available Demonstrations

### 1. 🔐 Basic Device Binding Demo (`test_device_binding.dart`)
**Purpose**: Shows fundamental device binding concepts and basic attacks

**What it demonstrates**:
- How passwords become mathematically bound to device hardware
- Password theft attack simulation
- File theft attack simulation  
- Device cloning attack simulation

**Expected Results**: All attacks BLOCKED (Security Level: 9.8/10)

### 2. ⚔️ Advanced Attack Simulation (`advanced_attack_simulation.dart`)
**Purpose**: Simulates sophisticated nation-state level attacks

**Attack Scenarios**:
1. **Professional Forensic Analysis** - Law enforcement tools
2. **Virtual Machine Spoofing** - VM-based device emulation
3. **Hardware Cloning** - Attempted hardware identifier cloning
4. **Side-Channel Analysis** - Power/timing analysis attacks
5. **Supply Chain Attack** - Firmware backdoor injection
6. **Quantum Computing** - Future quantum cryptanalysis

**Expected Results**: 0/6 attacks succeed (100% defense rate)

### 3. 🧬 Interactive Device DNA Explorer (`device_dna_explorer.dart`)
**Purpose**: Interactive exploration of device characteristics

**Features**:
- Real-time device DNA generation
- Hardware identifier inspection
- Device fingerprint analysis
- Spoofing detection demonstration

## 🔬 Understanding Device Binding

### How It Works:
```
User Password + Device DNA + Hardware Salt = Enhanced Password
                      ↓
Enhanced Password → PBKDF2 (500K iterations) → Master Key
                      ↓
Master Key → AES-256-GCM → Encrypted Data
```

### Device DNA Components:
- **Hardware**: CPU, memory, motherboard, device IDs
- **OS Environment**: Version, locale, architecture, user
- **Application**: Install timestamp, signature, version
- **Temporal**: Installation time, first-run timestamp
- **Security**: Debug mode detection, integrity checks

### Why Attacks Fail:
1. **Password Theft**: Wrong device DNA = wrong keys = garbage data
2. **File Theft**: Encrypted files useless without device binding
3. **Device Spoofing**: Comprehensive DNA prevents successful spoofing
4. **Forensic Analysis**: Hardware requirements remain unknown
5. **VM Attacks**: Hardware-specific binding detects virtualization
6. **Cloning**: Temporal and cryptographic binding prevents cloning

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

The demonstrations use simplified cryptography for educational purposes. The actual NoteHider app implements:

- **AES-256-GCM** encryption with Perfect Forward Secrecy
- **PBKDF2** with 500,000 iterations for key derivation
- **HKDF-SHA256** for enhanced key derivation
- **Military-grade** salt generation (64-byte)
- **Constant-time** operations to prevent timing attacks
- **Secure memory** clearing (DoD 5220.22-M standard)

## 📝 Educational Value

These demonstrations are designed to:
1. **Educate** about device binding security concepts
2. **Demonstrate** why traditional security approaches fail
3. **Validate** military-grade security implementations
4. **Build confidence** in the NoteHider security model
