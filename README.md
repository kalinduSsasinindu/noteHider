## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK 3.0+
- Dart SDK 2.17+

### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/notehider.git
cd notehider
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

### Security Demonstrations
Run comprehensive security tests to see device binding in action:

```bash
# Basic device binding demonstration

```

## 🎯 How Device Binding Works

### The Problem with Traditional Security
Traditional password-based security has fundamental weaknesses:
- 🚨 **Password theft** gives attackers full access
- 🚨 **File theft** allows offline brute force attacks
- 🚨 **Device cloning** can bypass many protections

### Our Solution: Military-Grade Device Binding

```
User Password + Device DNA + Hardware Salt = Enhanced Password
                      ↓
Enhanced Password → PBKDF2 (500K iterations) → Master Key
                      ↓
Master Key → AES-256-GCM → Encrypted Data
```

**Result**: Your password becomes **mathematically useless** without the exact device hardware!

### Device DNA Components
- **Hardware**: CPU architecture, core count, memory size
- **System**: OS version, build numbers, device IDs  
- **Environment**: Computer name, user account, locale
- **Temporal**: Installation timestamp, boot session
- **Security**: Debug mode detection, integrity checks

## ⚠️ Security Considerations

### Important Notes
- **Device Binding**: Data becomes device-specific (intended behavior)
- **Password Importance**: Password alone is insufficient without device
- **Physical Security**: Device theft remains a concern (use screen locks)
- **Quantum Threat**: Future quantum computers may pose risks
- **Backup Strategy**: Secure backup methods recommended

### Best Practices
1. **Enable Device Lock**: Use PIN/password/biometric device lock
2. **Regular Updates**: Keep app and OS updated
3. **Secure Passwords**: Use strong, unique passwords
4. **Physical Security**: Protect device from theft
5. **Emergency Procedures**: Know how to trigger emergency wipe
